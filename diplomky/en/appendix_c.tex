\chapter{Geneea Data}\label{app:geneea}

Geneea Analytics\footnote{\url{https://www.geneea.com}} is a company focusing on natural language processing.
We used their analysing tools extract additional linguistics properties.

The reviews were analysed and filtered on Geneea servers.
The resulting file is transferred to the local computer.
It has line-by-line correspondence to the instance file created locally.
An example of an analyzed review is bellow.
Note that we omitted unused parts of analysis; full analysis can be found in \texttt{data/geneea\_sample.json}.
