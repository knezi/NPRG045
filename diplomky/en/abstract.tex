%% Do not forget to edit abstract.xmpdata.

As the popularity of the online communication is increasing,
it is becoming infeasible for users to filter information manually.
It is therefore a demanded task to recognise relevant information in unstructured data.

The focus of this thesis is short text,
which is the prevailing form of text on e-commerce platforms and recommendation systems.
Short text classification is especially challenging, because it lacks any structure
and is often sparse or with mistakes.

In this thesis, we take restaurant reviews from Yelp.
Most restaurants have relatively many reviews, yet only few are truly useful.
Our objective is to compare state-of-the-art classifiers for predicting usefulness.
