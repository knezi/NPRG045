The demand for text classification keeps growing as more data needs to be processed automatically.
It is a hard problem to give users only relevant data and not to overwhelm them.
Text classification is a perfect tool for filtering irrelevant documents.
In this thesis, we will focus on classification of relatively short restaurant reviews and their usefulness.
Namely, we will test everything on datasets provided by Yelp.
Most restaurants have relatively many reviews, yet only few are truly useful.
Our primary goal is to build such a classifier that is able to predict usefulness.
Secondary, we will also focus on properties funny and cool.
