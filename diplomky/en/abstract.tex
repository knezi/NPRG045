%% Do not forget to edit abstract.xmpdata.

As the popularity of the online communication is increasing,
it is becoming infeasible for users to filter information manually.
It is therefore a demanded task to recognise relevant information in unstructured data.

The focus of this thesis is short text classification.
Short text is the prevailing form of text on e-commerce platforms and recommendation systems.
Classification of data in this form is especially challenging, because it lacks any structure
and is often sparse or with mistakes.

One of the possible application of machine learning is to automatically filter data
and show users only relevant pieces of information.
We work with restaurant reviews from Yelp and aim to predict their usefulness.
Most restaurants have relatively many reviews, yet only few are truly useful.
Our objective is to compare state-of-the-art classifiers for predicting usefulness.
