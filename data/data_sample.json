Chicken was deep fried - German authentic food is never deep fried however it is an German expired place, please keep in mind its NOT GERMAN FOOD!

I recently moved to Las Vegas from Chicago, and took advice from a co-worker to get my hair cut from her stylist. Needless to say, $60 later I had one of the worst cuts of my life, other than when my mom cut all my hair off in the early 90's...\n\nYou all know how terrifying it is to lose your hair dresser, thank you Yelp for being here! I was running errands two weeks ago on a day off from my busy schedule, and decided it was the day to try again. I rely on Yelp for most of what I do, eat, and drink around here because I have lived in Chicago for 27 years of my life.\n\nThat being said, I came across Hotbox on Yelp and read the reviews, for those of you that had a bad experience, I feel sorry for you! I was so excited when I walked in! Although it is tough to find from the outside. \n\nI was greeted promptly, offered several types of beverages, I chose sangria, and even though I was at minimum 30 minutes early, I was taken right away by Whitney! Boy was I lucky! I told her that I just wanted a good haircut. I didn't want to give her a picture or try to do her job. All the direction given was that I wanted to keep as much length as possible. I told her if she was good I didn't need to tell her what to do!!! She loved it! We got started and the entire process was PERFECT! She did everything she should have through the cutting process. I have worked in several salons in my days and i know what it takes to give a good haircut. I have a lot of hair that is heavy, she dried it completely which is a feat of its own, and then proceeded to flat iron and pin cut (thin) out my layers...she rocks! I told her I would be writing a review for her, thanks Whitney! You rock and I will see you soon!\n\nI absolutely enjoyed my experience so much that I purchased $120 worth of Moroccan Oil hair products from her! She was very informative about the product, what it does, and what it is made of. LOVE!", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "words": 400, "incorrect_words": 2}

You know, that office/business complex, right off of 485 on the Johnston Road exit, where the Red Robin and Earth Fare are both located? You know, there? Got it? See it? That building directly across the street from Red Robin? That's where I work. See me waving? Hi!\n\nSo my point to Toringdon is this: other than Red Robin (which, frankly, is pretty meh when it comes to burgers, and the atmosphere sucks) or Earth Fare (which, frankly, their take-out/dine-in options leave plenty to be desired, especially from such a place that supposedly prides itself on health food alternatives that cater to the surplus number of crunchy granolas living in exile from Asheville, and the die-hard fitness freaks that show up all sweaty and red-faced and all jacked-up on adrenaline and self-importance after having done some hardcore yoga at the Urban Active across the street...but anyway...), a quick or at least convenient meal that doesn't require you to get in your car and navigate the fustercluck that is Johnston Road during lunch time, AND you're pretty tired of brown bagging it every day, then what the hell are you going to do for lunch, huh?\n\nThankfully, Zeitouni Grill proves a more-than-welcome respite from the ordinary. And Zeitouni Grill does not disappoint.\n\nThe platters are always a good option. Choose from a trio of Shishes (I just made that word up) - Kabob, Tawooq, or Kefta - or the Shwarma (the \"Avengers\" Special! - You know what I'm talking about!), and you get your choice of two sides - hummus or babba ghanouj (neither will disappoint) and either tabbouleh, fatoush, or the Mediterranean salad. Personally, I love their falafel. I haven't had decent falafel since I left NYC, and this is about as close as what I used to sample when I slummed it on Lexington Avenue near Kips Bay. Simple fare, yet colorful and plenty flavorful, just as I would expect from this kind of cuisine.\n\nKeep in mind this place stays busy during weekday lunch hours, so be prepared to wait about 10-15 minutes for your plate. Worth the wait, though.\n\nI'm here about once a week. But this place is so damned good, I might be coming here more than once a week.

True to his French root, however, JMC takes off for a month long vacation in the middle of the summer. Where else should a girl turn to to satisfy her insatiable need of patisseries? A friend suggested that I try to fill the void with La Gourmandine (\"it's not cheating on JMC if it's closed.\"). \n\nI had previously passed on La Gourmandine, penalizing it (perhaps unfairly) for its hipper Lawrenceville address and its posher decor. But one fine Saturday morning, my croissant addiction got to me, so I finally caved and went in. \n\nHere is how I feel the two bakery stacked up against each other:\n* plain croissants -- JMC's are consistently better. At G's, one week's croissants were kind of doughy, but the next week's were nice and flaky\n* almond croissants -- I actually slightly prefers G's. JMC's almond croissants don't taste particularly almond-y, more like a vanilla pastry with some almond garnishes.\n* fruit pastries (apple turnovers, etc.) -- a tie. I think G's are sweeter and more dessert-like while JMC's are more like breakfast pastries.\n* dessert tarts -- JMC's hands down. More varied, fresher tasting.\n* opera cake -- here, I have to give the nod to G's. It is less dense and not as over-poweringly sweet as JMC's.\n\nSome other points I appreciated about La Gourmandine:\n* On Saturdays, G opens later than JMC. So whereas JMC's most popular items are sold out by 10am, I can saunter into G's as late as 11:30am and still get a wide selection.\n* It is easier to get to G's by public transportation than JMC's.\n* G offers sandwiches and other savory items. I've not tried them yet, but they do look delicious\n* The coffee at G's is better than the coffee at JMC's.\n\nAspects that favor JMC:\n* Overall La Gourmandine is maybe 20% more expensive.\n* Although the servers are cheerful and friendly, my purchasing experiences at La Gourmandine somehow feel less warm, more impersonal. \n* Sometimes, there are free samples at JMC's.\n* JMC has macarones\n\nSo what do I conclude from these comparisons? Well, Pittsburghers are pretty lucky to have a choice of decent patisseries!

After staying three nights, I can only conclude that some people are just high maintenance.\n\nThe hotel and its interior are very gold! Oddly, I'm normally quite disparaging of this aesthetic but in this case, I really liked it! The building has a white strip around the top which really works with the gold tint. Lots of marble too - great!\n\nUnlike many of the other places in Vegas, this is a hotel - not a casino with a hotel attached. As such, it doesn't suffer from the stink of second-hand smoke and the generally noisy and zoo-like environment. The moment you walk into the bright, (naturally) lit, spacious lobby, you realize that it's an oasis from the strip.\n\nSome mention has been made of its distance from the strip. Firstly, it's a 5 min walk, 10 tops. Secondly, it's through an air-conditioned mall, with Nordstrom, plenty of other shopping and cheap eats and coffee on your doorstep. If you're physically capable of a 5 min walk, I can only surmise that to complain about it means you're fat and lazy. Let me repeat that - fat and lazy. If you're one of these people, don't travel to any European city, as you'll be whining just to get to the end of the street.\n\nMention has also been made of a perfume that's piped into the AC of the lobby. True - and it's smells nice! I understand that it can bother those with a very sensitive nose but for the vast majority, it just helps make a nice environment (while we're on the subject of smells, the lotions and soaps provided in the rooms smell lovely).\n\nService was excellent. So many great individual interactions with staff who just excel at their roles and are super friendly. \n\nThe room condition was excellent. Spacious ( very ), big beds and well furnished. Love the huge bathroom with double sinks, big tub and shower. Don't really know why the kitchenettes are there but not an issue. A TV in the bathroom mirror was just fun for its own sake. Odd design issue - couldn't find a single, central switch for all the lights. My personal highlight was the massage jets in the bathtub - if you stay here, you must try them out!\n\nThe resort fees seems to be the norm in Vegas and the general ethos in America. As a European, I prefer the price to be the price, taxes and all included. This extends to the valet-only parking, which is just an annoyance and not a luxury (i.e. valet in general is a silly American concept - if I'm driving a car, I can bloody well park it myself or I shouldn't be driving in the first place. And if I have a really nice car, why the hell would I let some stranger with limited education drive and potentially damage it?). Don't get me started on tipping which is just a way to degrade the working class to the status of plebs but I digress. I would definitely take note of the fact that parking at the adjacent mall is free, so is a faster option if you just want to pop in and out.\n\nUsed the gym - lovely and everything was in excellent condition with hand towels provided. The pool wasn't a party type of place, just a really nice luxury hotel pool.\n\nMy only issue, and one that might be unfair, is that when traveling in Europe, hotels always include breakfast. Doesn't seem to be the case here but if no-one else is doing it, then it's unfair to pick on any one hotel.\n\nMy companions mentioned that they can hear the train horn at various times during the night, so that can be an issue if you're a light sleeper. It's funny though - some reviews complain about the train noise but want to be on the strip, which surely generates much more noise at all hours!?\n\n4 pm checkout also helped us maximize the value of our time in Vegas, though, again there's the mall parking as an option.\n\nAnother reviewer noted the weak water pressure from the shower. That bothered me too but I'm not sure why it exists - it makes sense from a water conservation perspective ( I'm all for that ) and that the Kohler fittings are water-efficient but then the bath water pressure is higher and taking baths is far more water-inefficient than showers. Odd.\n\nThe other clientele are middle to upper class, often professionals and well-travelled foreigners. Not to sound too much like a snob but birds of a feather...\n\nThe hotel bar closes way too early. Hotel bars are a great way to meet people, whether at the start of the evening or late night for one last drink. \n\nBottom line : While in Vegas, I will ONLY stay at The Trump Hotel... but maybe not dine at the hotel restaurant until there's new management, as it seems to have some well publicized issues!", "useful": 3, "funny": 3, "cool": 1, "words": 871, "incorrect_words": 7}
